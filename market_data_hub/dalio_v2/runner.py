runner.py — orchestrates the Dalio v2 engines and writes engine_scores.

Additive: never touches dalio_signals/pillar_scores/regime_state (dalio.py
keeps producing the current report unchanged). See
docs/DALIO_5ENGINE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2026-07.md §1 (non-goal).

Usage:
    from market_data_hub.dalio_v2.runner import run_dalio_v2
    run_dalio_v2()                      # all 5 engines, current year
