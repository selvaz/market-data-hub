scoring.py — shared helpers for the Dalio v2 5-engine architecture.

See docs/DALIO_5ENGINE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2026-07.md (Fase 0/Fase 3 design
decisions) for the rationale: linear threshold-to-score interpolation
instead of crisp if/elif buckets, hysteresis on bucket transitions so a
score oscillating near a boundary does not flip label every run, and an
explicit coverage tier per engine score so partial data is never silently
treated as full coverage. (The plan's robust median/MAD z-score helper was
removed as dead code in the 2026-07 audit -- no engine ended up using
cross-country z's; political_execution uses percentile_rank instead.)
