"""Best-effort bridge from market-data-hub jobs to LazyTools' operations catalog.

The actual start/finish/register_* logic lives once in
``lazytools.operations.integration`` (shared with LazyCrawler's identically
shaped shim) so a fix only has to happen in one place. This file only needs
to exist locally because the import of ``lazytools`` itself must stay
optional: a scheduled data job must keep running even if LazyTools isn't
installed in this environment.
